**Data Challenge 2022 Pitch Project**


Hello Data Challenge Finalists! Here is the prompt and dataset for the project work portion of the program. Each finalist will work on their own pitch deck, but will meet with their group a few times throughout the summer to talk out any roadblocks and get mentor feedback. The last group meeting will be when each finalist presents their product proposal.

Please note: the product scenario listed below is completely hypothetical and was created just for Data Challenge 2022. 

**The New Product:**

You're part of an experimental team -- and you've finally convinced Mark to fund some exploration into starting ‚ÄúZuckflix.‚Äù The project doesn't have a large budget, so the data team has been tasked with investigating what content we should be buying and producing for Zuckflix. 

We have access to a dataset with information about content on Netflix -- and we'd like to analyze trends in the content they're adding to their catalog (the first secret of operations research: when in doubt, copy the market leader üòâ) -- hopefully with this, we can figure out what to shoot first!

**The Dataset:**

Netflix Movie & TV Shows dataset on Kaggle

This dataset should provide all the information you need to analyze trends and create your pitch, but you are welcome to incorporate other data sources if you so choose.

**The Exploratory Phase:**

Begin by exploring how the content that Netflix has added each year has changed over time. Some questions you might consider are:
Are there notable differences by country?
What genres have gotten more or less popular?
Is Netflix investing more in TV shows or movies? What trends are there in the length of movies or the number of seasons of TV shows?
Are there certain actors or directors that Netflix seems to like?

**The Pitch Phase:**

Now that you're an expert in Netflix‚Äôs offerings, you need to pitch Mark on a strategy for Zuckflix. 

Make a recommendation for what type of content we should have on Zuckflix. In addition to your overall recommendation, pick a country and make a recommendation for the type of content we should have for that country in particular.

In your pitch deck, you should:
Pitch your overall and country-specific recommendations in a 5 minute presentation.
Support your recommendations using your findings from the exploratory phase.
Be sure to include visualizations of your findings, Mark loves charts.
Note: you don‚Äôt need to include all the exploration you did, only the findings that are relevant to the recommendations you are making!

What we are looking for:
PRESENTATION‚Äã
Can someone with limited data science experience follow your presentation?‚Äã
Are figures, tables, and charts presentable and easy to understand? ‚Äã
Did you answer the question? Are your recommendations clear?‚Äã
CREATIVITY‚Äã
Are you able to get meaningful insight from the data?‚Äã
Does your presentation tell a non-obvious story?‚Äã
STRATEGIC THINKING‚Äã
Are your answers practical?‚Äã
Are your takeaways actionable?

Data Visualization Tips:
Keep your visualizations simple, highlighting the insight that supports your recommendations. 
Bar charts and line charts are very effective for comparing metric values or different subgroups 
Try to stay away from pie charts as they are difficult for the human brain to interpret accurately
